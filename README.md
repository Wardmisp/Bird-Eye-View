# Bird-Eye-View

ECE Paris senior year project.

Aiming at creating a bird-eye view from the surroundings of a car, based on cameras images with segmantic segmentation placed on the car.

## Progress 
- [x] Implementing first model in PyTorch
- [ ] Importing and preprocessing data (by using already existing data, or exporting data from Carla on our own)
- [ ] Testing first model
- [ ] Implementing other NN architecture
- [ ] Compare the results
- [ ] Implement other features 

## Data

Our Data will be provided by the CARLA simulator.
More details incoming later.

## Model

We are currently rebuilding 3 models from [this repository](https://github.com/MankaranSingh/Auto-Birds-Eye), using PyTorch Library.
